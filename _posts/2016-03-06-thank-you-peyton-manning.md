  You actually had me worried for a bit... I think I speak for the rest of the world when I say that we all expected your retirement announcement within a week after the Super Bowl. But with free agency racing towards us, you forced everyone to hold their collective breaths and pray that you were not channeling your inner Favre. I know, I just typed the name of "he who must not be named", but I have to get this point across. Elway exited the game at the perfect time, taking advantage of the perfect opportunity. I had hoped that he would be in Peyton's ear, whispering tidbits of retirement truths, gently coaxing him out into pasture. But with each report of "Manning's not ready", or "contract talks with Brock continue to be on hold out of respect", I was really getting nervous. Please, please, please don't try to get back in the ring, like some aged Rocky Balboa that is unable to glean some other sense of purpose from what has to be a rich and fulfilling life...
  
  As I have stated before, Favre's "attempt" at a continuing career after leaving the Packers was funny (texting pics of his junk to Jenn Sterger), yet sad (his general on-the-field performance). He looked out of place in the Jets colors, and like a stunt double for Barney the dinosaur when he played for the Vikings. Peyton will go down as the best in NFL history, and has more intelligence than Brady and Coach BeliCheat put together. He didn't need to tarnish his legacy by staying on the field another season, because, let's be honest; it probably wasn't going to be pretty... His throws this year made me cringe and I hoped that he had the presence of mind to realize it. Well evidently he did, and it was the right decision. Thank you Peyton Manning for not pulling a "Favre".
