<p>Yeah, I know that I neglected my blog for a while. I also know that since that time the nonsensical ramblings of the uninformed and certifiably stupid have gotten out of control. Hence the need to return. But before you plop down in hopes of my returning you to football nirvana, I must warn you; this will be short. Work is kicking my ass, and as your leader, I do not have to explain myself to you. Just be glad that I have returned to enrich your lives and lets move on.</p>
<p>I was perusing NFL.com today during my government mandated 15 minute break and came across one of the most beautiful things I have seen on the gridiron. Next to the 'Discount Double Check' of course... Reading through the list of the top undrafted free agents in NFL history, I came across a pic of Marion Motley. Marion was a bruising running back that started his playing career for the Browns right after World War II. Take a look at the shoes that he and the other players are wearing. Yes, those are Chuck Taylors. God, I love football. If you don't see how that is one of the coolest things ever, then close this window and don't come back.
