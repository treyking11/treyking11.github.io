<p>I am not going to lie. It took a LONG time before I was able to talk about football after last year's epic meltdown. A looooong time. I boycotted the Super Bowl, eventually breaking down to watch the last 5 minutes of regulation, and am so very glad that I did. How does a big dose of poetic justice taste, Pete Carroll? Mmmmmmm, good... Suck it, Seahawks. But I digress! The season is right around the corner, and it is my duty, my responsibility, to continue to shine my written light of truth on those who yearn for total football consciousness. With that being said, I have rebuilt my blog and will continue to write with reckless abandon until we bring home the trophy named after OUR legendary leader. Then it is wash / rinse / repeat.</p>
<p>Occasionally I will pontificate (express one's opinions in a way considered annoyingly pompous and dogmatic, which TOTALLY fits me) on general football insight because, lets face it, there are a lot of idiots in the NFL whose antics on and off the field deserve our laughter. Other times I might wax poetic about totally unrelated things because there are six days between games and I get bored easily...</p>
<p>This site will grow in functionality over the next several months, hopefully including a member sign-in with comment abilities. I am coding this by hand myself in my free time, so dont expect anything overnight... Regardless, thanks for the visit, and please check back regularly or grab my RSS feed (the link is at the bottom of the page). This will be a great season, my friends. We are stacked across the board and I expect an exciting year!</p>
<p>GO PACK GO!!</p>
