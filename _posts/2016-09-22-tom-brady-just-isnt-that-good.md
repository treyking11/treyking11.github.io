<p>I have a completely different perspective on the 'cheating-est' team in the NFL, and it is a positive one, believe it or not. The New England Patriots have a system in place that is second to none, and I mean that. Yes, they are the 'Lance Armstrongs' of football, but what this team has done without Tom Brady has more than surprised me. Going 3-0 (as of tonight) with Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett (who the hell is that?) didn't seem possible, yet it has revealed an ugly truth.</p>
<p>Let me explain. Watching porn in high definition seems like it would be a great thing. But in reality, the clarity of events exposes things you aren't intended to see. Bad Skin. Poor grooming. The occasional butt pimple. 'Trey, where the hell are you going with this?', I can hear you ask. Well, it pains me to say it, but Tom Brady IS THAT BUTT PIMPLE! Now, I understand that every 'Masshole' that is reading this is right now is cursing me with their silly accent, proclaiming that Tom is the second coming and bravely listing all of the sexual acts that they would perform on him, but hear me out. You see those numbers below? They are proof that Tom Brady just isn't that good.</p>

<p>194-60 (.764)</p>
<p>14-5 (.734)</p>


<p>The top numbers are Tom's career win/loss numbers (including the post season), along with the winning percentage. The bottom numbers? They are the backup QB's (Cassel, Garoppolo, and Brissett) numbers with the winning percentage. See anything peculiar? That's right, the winning percentages are nearly identical. Brady's winning percentage is, for all intents and purposes, no better than his those of his backups. The system is doing the winning. The 'Cheatriots' just bulldozed the Texans 27-0 without Gronk or Brady, and did it with a rookie QB and a C-grade running back (at best). Do I think that Patriot's star QB sucks? No, that's what I think of their fans, but it certainly is fun when you are able to make a far-fetched statement with indisputable facts... 'Nuff said.</p>
