When is it time to change the sheets? WHEN YOU SHIT THE DAMN BED!!!!

Gee-zus christ. I could stop there, and I probably should. But, I can't stop my mouth any better than the Packers can stop frigging Jay Cuntler. I have been delaying any posts after the Broncos debacle until either 1) The Packers started playing like a respectable damn team, or 2) I was in a better mood. Well neither has happened, and I realized that I should post something so you didn't think I was dead. We start 6-0, then lose 4 out of 5. We trail the goddam Vikings in the division, and lose two in a row at Lambeau. WTF!

At least start out shitty if you are going to finish shitty, then at least I can get become acclimated. But don't start off the season so hot that people scream Super Bowl and MVP, then suffer prime time aneurysms week after week. I hate the Patriots (who doesn't outside of New England?) but they make the most of their opportunities (except for the perfect season + Super Bowl loss...) knowing that they only have Mr. Giselle Bundchen for a finite period of time. So is our time with ARod. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER WITH WHAT WE HAVE WHILE WE HAVE IT. We have been melting down at all the wrong times, going back to last year's NFC championship. Teams with less are doing more, and I pray that we can get it together soon...
