<p>I have waited as long as I could to address this topic. Yes, I was DYING to post something the day after Cam Newton realized that it was the 5th easiest schedule that made him look so good. But it would have been lost in the noise from the 300 million Americans doing the same thing... "If you don't like my dancing, don't let me score", I think he said. Well the Broncos not only accepted your challenge, hot shot, they SHUT YOU DOWN. I am not a 'hater', and I am not racist (you do realize playing the race card IS racist, right?), but I simply cannot stand showboating. Act like you have been there before, and save your painstakingly choreographed dances for you posse.</p>
<p>Which brings me to today's topic. Yesterday Cam announced that he is no longer using the 'dab', which makes sense because IT IS NO LONGER HIS! The Broncos defense took it from you Cam, and I hope they use it all season long this year. Putting a kleenex up to his eyes was the last bit of dabbing he will ever do. Now let's see what kind of 'look at me' nonsense you can conjure up now. It all revolves around maturity, and he is sorely lacking. During the 2012 season, when Carolina lost it's 5th game putting them at 1-5, even the great Warren Moon questioned the young QB. "The big thing with him is he doesn't like losing," Moon told Yahoo! Sports. "He doesn't handle it very well. I don't see anything wrong with that. It's OK not to like losing. You just can't show it as the leader of the football team." Then he goes on to say, "I would tell him his demeanor's got to change in the face of adversity. It's more of a maturity thing — he's got to grow up in this area.". Consider the fact that Newton was more than willing to celebrate a touchdown with his Superman touchdown celebration — with his team down 23-0 — in a blowout loss to the Giants at home earlier that season... OK, now we fast forward 4 years, and he hasn't matured ONE BIT. He is STILL a spoiled child... </p>
<p> As the Carolina Players cleaned out their lockers after that highly publicized beat-down, he was kind enough to add this; "I've been on record to say I'm a sore loser, who likes to lose? You show me a good loser and I'm going to show you a loser. It's not a popularity contest. I'm here to win football games." Well Cam, after the beating that you took on Super Bowl Sunday, you should be sore. And as for showing me a loser? No need; he's at the mic.</p>
