Let me begin by saying that I have issues. I KNOW I have issues. I have been a Green Bay Packers fan since I was a kid, and my obsession just keeps getting worse. I know it's just a game. I know that it doesn't have any real bearing on my ordinary life. But on Sundays, none of that matters. I live and die with the Pack, and take each loss (however infrequent they are) personally. I love the fact that the Packers are the only professional sports team in the country without an owner. I love the fact that Green Bay is the smallest city to host a major professional team in any sport, yet has the second largest and second oldest stadium (mmmmm. smell the real grass?). When referring to the team I use the pronoun 'we'. I could go on and on, and I will. That is, after all, the whole point of this site. I dont just bleed for these guys, I bleed cheese...
